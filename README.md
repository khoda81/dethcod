# Neural Network-Based Lossless Compression with Sequence-to-Sequence Transformers

This project explores a novel approach to lossless data compression utilizing sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transformers. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, which often rely on fixed heuristics or statistical methods, our approach leverages the power of neural networks to learn complex patterns in data sequences for more efficient compression and decompression.

## Overview

Lossless compression is a crucial aspect of data storage and transmission. Our research focuses on developing a neural network-based solution that not only achieves high compression ratios but also maintains data integrity through the compression-decompression process.

## Disclaimer

This project is purely experimental and should be treated as a research endeavor. While we strive for accurate compression and decompression results, there might be limitations and unforeseen issues in the implementation. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution when using this algorithm in production or mission-critical environments.
